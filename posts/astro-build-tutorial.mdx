### This is a Markdown sub-heading

We just used a `###` subheading in our blog post.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    const doStuff = () => {
      return console.log('hey')
    }
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

```
  // this is a code block
  const doSomething = () => {
    return console.log('hey')
  }
```
